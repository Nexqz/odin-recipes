    <h2>Hearty Japanese Noodle Soup with Depth of Flavor</h2>
    <p>
      Ramen is a traditional Japanese noodle soup that consists of a savory
      broth, often flavored with soy sauce, miso, or pork, and topped with
      ingredients such as slices of pork belly, soft-boiled eggs, green onions,
      and bamboo shoots. The noodles are perfectly slurpable, and the rich,
      umami-packed broth provides a deeply satisfying meal. Ramen has become a
      global favorite, enjoyed for its comforting and customizable nature.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>4 cups chicken or vegetable broth</li>
      <li>2 cups water</li>
      <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 tbsp miso paste (optional)</li>
      <li>1 tbsp sesame oil</li>
      <li>2 packs of ramen noodles (or fresh ramen)</li>
      <li>1/2 lb pork belly or chicken breast (sliced thin, optional)</li>
      <li>2 boiled eggs (soft-boiled)</li>
      <li>1/2 cup green onions (sliced)</li>
      <li>1/4 cup bamboo shoots (optional)</li>
      <li>1/4 cup corn (optional)</li>
      <li>1 sheet nori (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Make the broth:</strong> In a large pot, combine the chicken or
        vegetable broth and water. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Add soy
        sauce, miso paste (if using), and sesame oil. Stir until well combined
        and the miso dissolves into the broth. Let simmer while preparing other
        ingredients.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Prepare the protein:</strong> If using pork belly, pan-fry the
        slices in a separate skillet until crispy on both sides. If using
        chicken, cook the chicken breasts, then slice them thinly.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Boil the noodles:</strong> In a separate pot, bring water to a
        boil. Cook the ramen noodles according to package instructions (usually
        3-4 minutes). Drain and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Assemble the ramen:</strong> Divide the cooked noodles into
        bowls. Pour the hot broth over the noodles. Add the protein (pork or
        chicken), boiled egg halves, green onions, bamboo shoots, corn, and any
        other toppings you'd like.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Serve:</strong>Serve the ramen hot, garnished with a sheet of
        nori, additional green onions, or chili oil if desired.
      </li>
