    <h2>Savory Bites Wrapped in Tender Dough</h2>
    <p>
      Dumplings are a beloved dish across many cultures, offering a variety of
      fillings like pork, beef, chicken, or vegetables, all encased in a soft
      dough. The dough can be steamed, boiled, or fried, with each method adding
      its own texture and flavor to the bite-sized delights. Often served with
      dipping sauces or in broths, dumplings are perfect for sharing and can be
      enjoyed as a main dish or appetizer.

        <strong>Prepare the filling:</strong> In a bowl, mix together the ground
        meat, cabbage, green onions, garlic, ginger, soy sauce, sesame oil, rice
        vinegar, and cornstarch (if using). Stir until well combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Assemble the dumplings:</strong> Place a small spoonful of
        filling in the center of each dumpling wrapper. Fold the wrapper in half
        and pinch the edges together to seal, forming pleats along the edge if
        desired.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cook the dumplings:</strong>

            <strong>Boiling:</strong> Bring a pot of water to a boil. Drop in
            the dumplings and cook for about 5-6 minutes, until they float to
            the surface.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Steaming:</strong> Steam the dumplings over boiling water
            for 8-10 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Pan-frying:</strong> Heat some oil in a skillet, add the
            dumplings, and cook until the bottoms are golden, then add a bit of
            water to steam for 3-4 minutes until fully cooked.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Enjoy your dumplings with a dipping sauce made of soy sauce, vinegar, and chili oil.</li>
